* Improved "memory low" event detection.
* More information will be recorded when the "memory low" event is triggered.
* It's now possible to disable "memory low" detection, which seems to cause problems on some ROMs.
* Update of the Spanish translation (thanks to @gallegonovato).

NOTE: The application will crash if this option is disabled but the event is triggered by the system.
